# [Deprecated] Portenta Machine Control Library for Arduino

> [!WARNING]
> This library is deprecated and no longer actively maintained.
>
> We recommend transitioning to the [Arduino_PortentaMachineControl](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_PortentaMachineControl) library for ongoing support, new features and contributions. If you need assistance with migration, refer to the [migration guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-machine-control/pmc-arduino-library).
>
> Please note that the [examples](./examples/) provided with this library are not compatible with the new library.

Arduino Library for the Portenta Machine Control

The Portenta Machine Control enhances existing products with minimal effort, allowing companies to implement a standard platform across different equipment models. It is now easy to create an infrastructure of interconnected machines, which can be controlled onsite or via the cloud when needed; moreover, human-machine interaction can be further enahnced via mobile apps thanks to BLE connectivity.
